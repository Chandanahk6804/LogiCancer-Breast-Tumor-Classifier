# Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

This project applies a logistic regression model to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The primary goal is to demonstrate a basic machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading** â€“ Import and explore the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Drop unnecessary columns and handle missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** â€“ Understand data distribution and class imbalance.
4. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Encode categorical variables and scale features.
5. **Model Building** â€“ Train a logistic regression classifier.
6. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Evaluate using accuracy and classification report.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib
